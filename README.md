PythonToScala
=============

The goal of this project is to be a Rosetta stone for those transitioning from Python to Scala. This is by *no means* meant to be a complete guide to Scala, but rather some (hopefully) helpful snippets of code to help you translate Python syntax to Scala.

This guide loosely follows the text of [Scala for the Impatient](http://www.horstmann.com/scala/index.html), a great introductory book for those learning Scala. You might find it helpful to read it alongside the chapters from this repo.

Note that in general, translating idioms from one language to another is a bad idea. You should strive to write idiomatic Scala, which appears to be largely defined by the team at Twitter's [Effective Scala](http://twitter.github.io/effectivescala/)

I recommend reading through the guide in the following order:

1. Variables and Arithmetic
2. Conditionals
3. Functions
4. Strings
5. Arrays
6. Maps
7. Tuples
8. Exceptions
9. Classes
