PythonToScala
=============

The goal of this project is to be a Rosetta stone for those transitioning from Python to Scala. This is by *no means* meant to be a complete guide to Scala, but rather some (hopefully) helpful snippets of code to help you translate Python syntax to Scala.

This guide largely follows the text of [Scala for the Impatient](http://www.horstmann.com/scala/index.html), a great introductory text for those learning Scala. You might find it helpful to read the book alongside the chapters from this repo.

Note that in general, translating idioms from one language to another is a bad idea. You should write idiomatic Scala, which appears to be largely defined by the team at Twitter's [Effective Scala](http://twitter.github.io/effectivescala/)
